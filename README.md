# speck

This code was written to help my mum, who volunteers at a food bank. 
Every time a delivery goes out she (or one of the other volunteers) needs to find the most suitable order in which to make the deliveries.
The problem is compounded by the fact that there are often multiple drivers and the orders need to be partitioned appropriately between them.
The usual solution to this is to add each address into something like Google Maps to visualise where each address is.
However, this process takes ages!

This project attempts to solve this problem by providing an alternative visualisation tool. 
On running the program, users will see an interactive, Google Maps-esque map next to a table where addresses can be entered.
Having entered these addresses, simply click "Process inputs" and the (numbered) addresses will be located and displayed on the map.

It's called the somewhat confusing name of **speck** because it shows little dots on a map, and also because every open source project needs a dumb name!

## Installation

Speck should run on any modern browser (i.e. not Internet Explorer).
To install simply download the code using either `git` or just download a ZIP file and extract it.
If you then open `index.html` with your browser of choice (again, not Internet Explorer!) then everything should work out of the box.
